I love to program, learn new technology's, and working on them. I also enjoy a variety of movies and books.

Currently completed my engineering course and am working for a start-up,[recruiterbox](http://recruiterbox.com).We mostly use python with Django and JavaScript for our work.My work is mostly on the back-end with python. Some times rarely with JavaScript too.
